![Sentinel](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Ks5U_sFQ13mjQD9coGwj7M3UVfARepiEqIscAWh3DNEvdqeIh-S-F8k6sQiE8SIT4zrOGPXmRyMLOy5kg13D5AVIDuspRRs4)

Sentinel is a top-secret ultra-sophisticated CIA tool for counter-espionage missions. In the hands of highly skilled agents, Sentinel can be used to collect and analyze valuable information about intelligence activities of enemy nations inside sovereign frontiers.
## Installation
### Elixir

To install Elixir on your local environment you can use the [ASDF manager](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf).
To install the version being used by this project you can use the `asdf install` command.

### Application

To install the dependencies of this project run `mix deps.get`.

To start Sentinel just run `mix run --no-halt` in the command line of your cutting-edge spionage device (a.k.a computer).

For the first time it runs, Sentinel will fetch information about its target and parse it. Sentinel will also cache the parsed information in memory in order to avoid showing itself too much and raising suspicion about its activities. The information will be refreshed every two hours in order to keep track of the latest super suspicious reviews. In the case of the counter-counter-intelligence (yep, two times) of the target identifies and puts Sentinel down, the information acquired will be available on disk. As soon as Sentinel resurrects from its ashes, the information will be ready to be analyzed even if there is no internet. By the time internet connection is available again, Sentinel will fetch new information about the target suspicious activities of selling cars and having good reviews from its customers.
